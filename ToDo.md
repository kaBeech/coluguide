# To Do

## Last

- Add basic auth with Pow

## Next

- Add Frontent Functions

## Features to make sure to add

- MMS delivery lookup

## Notes

- Until we get the actual auth working, we'll use manual pseudo-email auth. This requires that a user enter their email/password, then I go into the logs and get the confirmation link to manually send to them, then they click the link to confirm the registration.
