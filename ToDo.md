# To Do

## Things to address

- Make duplicate Chapter, Guide, Step, etc. tables. One will be used for 
pre-seeded data, the other for user-created data. This way I (or other Coluguide 
maintainers) can adjust pre-seeded content without getting id's mixed up with
ids from user-created content.

## Features to make sure to add

- Delivery lookup
