# GuideMe

This is a knowledge enhancement application I originally built using Tauri,
then rebuilt as a web application in Elixir with Phoenix and LiveView

To start the Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Then you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
